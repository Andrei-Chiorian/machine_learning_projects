# Machine Learning Algorithms & Data Manipulation with Python

This repository includes a series of exercises and examples that cover various machine learning algorithms and data manipulation techniques using Python and Scikit-learn. The goal is to provide a set of examples that demonstrate how to apply different algorithms and techniques to real-world datasets.

## Content

The project includes implementations of the following algorithms and techniques:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Polynomial Regression**
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
5. **Decision Trees**
6. **Random Forests**
7. **Naive Bayes**
8. **Clustering Algorithms**
9. **Isolation Forest**
10. **Neural Networks**

### Additional Techniques:

- Dataset splitting
- Data preparation and preprocessing
- Pipeline and transformer creation
- Model selection
- Feature selection
- Feature extraction with PCA

## Datasets

The repository includes two datasets used for testing the mentioned algorithms:

1. **Real email dataset**: Located in `/datasets/`
2. **NSL-KDD dataset** (network packets): Located in `/datasets/nsl-kdd/`
